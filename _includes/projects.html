    <h3> Software Notes for Regression & Forecasting (ISyE 4031) </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Featured Skills</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have created detailed Jupyter Notebooks for implementing Regression
        models in Python using StatsModels and Sci-Kit Learn and for visualizing the results
        using Seaborn and Matplotlib. I also include additional derivation 
        as supplementary material to provide students ituition behind many fundamental concepts. I also plan to go through
        Machine Learning models and concepts to supplement classroom knowledge.

    <h3> Redesigned Event Valuation </h3>
    <p>For Senior Design, our team worked with the Georgia World Congress Center 
        to transform their business model to a data-driven assessment 
        of profitability on a per event basis. We implemented three models 
        to achieve this goal: a rooms-to-event assignment optimization model, 
        a cost prediction model, and a profit margin classification. 
        We also designed a web app to integrate the three models. <br> <br>
        As a result, we were awarded the Best ISyE project at the Fall 2019 Capstone Design Expo
    and Best Senior Design project for the course.</p>

      <h3> Via-Diet </h3>
      <p>For a Viasat hackathon, our team created a web app to track
          employee nutrition intake throughout a work day. By tracking food
          purchases, we created interactive visualizations to track 
          key macros. I used Flask and SQLite for the back-end and HTML/Bootstrap/D3 
          for the front-end and interactive visualizations.
