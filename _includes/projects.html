    <h3> Course Material for ISyE 4031: Regression/Forecasting </h3>
    <p>I have created Jupyter Notebooks as course material to help students implement and diagnose regression
        models in Python using StatsModels and Sci-Kit Learn. I also include additional derivation 
        as supplementary material to provide students intuition behind many fundamental concepts,
        and I review visualization libraries and techniques in Seaborn. I also plan to go through
        additional concepts to supplement classroom material related to Machine Learning.

    <h3> Redesigned Event Valuation </h3> 
    <p>For my Senior Capstone, my team and I worked with the <a href="https://www.gwcca.org/">Georgia World Congress Center</a>, the third largest convention center in the US,
        to transform their business model to a data-driven assessment 
        of profitability on a per event basis. We implemented three models 
        to achieve this goal: a rooms-to-event assignment optimization model, 
        a cost prediction model, and a profit margin classification tool. 
        We integrated the three models in a fully interactive web app that is currently implemented. Overall,
        our project is projected to increase annual profits by $1.1 million (18%). The technical details
        of our models are contained in the Appendix of our 
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gqJ-iaCK5zyCTelO7sZwBbTR0aj3gJrT">final report</a>. <br> <br>
        We were also <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu/news/isye-senior-design-team-wins-fall-capstone-expo">awarded</a>
         the Best ISyE project at the Fall 2019 Capstone Design Expo
    and Best Senior Design project for the course.

      <h3> Via-Diet </h3>
      <p>For a Viasat hackathon, our team created a web app to track
          employee nutrition intake throughout a work day. By tracking food
          purchases, we created interactive visualizations to track 
          key macros throughout the day. I used Flask and SQLite for the back-end and HTML/Bootstrap/D3 
          for the front-end and interactive visualizations.
