      <h1>Here's a little bit about me!</h1>
      
      <p>I'm an aspiring data scientist and incoming data science intern at 
        <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/" style="color:#4699d4; text-decoration: none;">Roblox</a>! 
        Previously, I was a data science intern at 
        <a href="https://www.gas-south.com/default.aspx" style="color:#4699d4; text-decoration: none;">Gas South</a>
        and 
        <a href="https://www.viasat.com/" style="color:#4699d4; text-decoration: none;">Viasat.</a>
        Graduating from Georgia Tech this Spring 2020 with a B.S. in Industrial Engineering,
        I plan to attend graduate school in the Fall for an M.S. in Analytics.
          <br> <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Code. Teach. Dance.</h3>
        I enjoy performing most data science tasks in Python and visualizations
        in Seaborn and D3. One of my greatest passions is in teaching, and I've
        been a TA for Statistics and Regression courses for 2 years, winning the 2019
        Outstanding Undergraduate TA award.
        I also founded and currently lead 
        <a href="https://youtube.com/gtseoulstice" style="color:#4699d4; text-decoration: none;">Seoulstice</a>,
        a K-Pop dance team 
        that has won at competitions and perform for over 15 events every year!

    <p>I perform data science tasks mostly in Python, using Sci-Kit Learn, 
      Pandas, NumPy, etc. for analytics and Machine Learning. 
      For visualizations, I am comfortable with anything ranging from 
      Matplotlib/Seaborn to D3!</p>
